# Configuration Files

This folder contains YAML configuration files that define
**what traits are extracted** during phenotyping.

The pipeline is entirely configuration-driven:
- No code changes are required
- Experiments are reproducible
- Trait selection is explicit and transparent

This design enables rapid experimentation and clean separation
between implementation and analysis intent.
