# Leaf Phenotyping Pipeline – Methodology Overview

## Overview
The leaf phenotyping workflow focuses on accurate estimation of
leaf size, shape, and venation characteristics from RGB images.

## Key Steps
1. Leaf segmentation and contour extraction
2. Length and width estimation using contour geometry
3. Skeleton-based width profiling
4. Optional vein network extraction and pruning
5. Trait aggregation and visualization

## Vein Analysis
Vein analysis, when enabled, produces skeletonized vein networks
used to estimate vein density and branching characteristics.
