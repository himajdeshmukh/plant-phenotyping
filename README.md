# Image-Based Leaf & Pod Phenotyping  
### Configuration-Driven Computer Vision Pipeline (Demonstration)

## Why This Project Matters

High-throughput phenotyping is a critical bottleneck in modern agriculture,
plant breeding, and crop improvement programs.

Manual trait measurement is:
- Time-consuming
- Subjective
- Not scalable
- Accuracy is almost impossible for pod phenotyping
  
This project demonstrates a **fully automated image-based phenotyping pipeline**
designed to extract **biologically meaningful traits** from leaf and pod images
using robust computer vision and morphological analysis.

## What This Repository Shows (Without Sharing Code)

This repository intentionally **does not include source code**.

Instead, it showcases:
- ✔ Real outputs generated by the pipeline
- ✔ Configuration-driven experimental design
- ✔ Advanced computer vision and graph-based analysis
- ✔ Reproducible, analysis-ready outputs
- ✔ Scientific and engineering decision-making

## Core Tools & Technologies Used

Although the implementation is private, the pipeline is built using
industry-standard scientific tooling:

### Computer Vision & Image Processing
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- NumPy

### Morphological & Geometric Analysis
- Skeleton-based length and width estimation
- Robust width aggregation
- Contour geometry (Feret diameters)
- Shape descriptors (area, perimeter, circularity, solidity)
- Fractal dimension analysis

### Graph & Network Analysis (Leaf Veins)
- NetworkX
- Skeleton-to-graph conversion
- Vein density and branching metrics

### Data Engineering
- Pandas
- CSV and Excel reporting
- Timestamped, reproducible runs

### Configuration-Driven Design
- YAML-based metric selection
- Modular enabling/disabling of advanced traits
- No code changes required to modify experiments

## Phenotyping Capabilities

### Pod Phenotyping
- Area, length, width (mean/min/max)
- Elongation and straightness
- Shape complexity and fractal dimension
- Optional Fourier descriptors
- Approximate volume estimation
- Visual overlays for quality control

### Leaf Phenotyping
- True maximum length and width
- Skeleton-based width profiling
- Area, perimeter, aspect ratio
- Circularity, solidity, extent
- Fractal dimension
- Optional vein network analysis

## Visual Quality Control

Every measurement is paired with annotated images showing:
- Object detection
- Skeleton paths
- Length and width markers
- Vein network visualizations (when enabled)

This ensures **trust, interpretability, and scientific validity**.
