# Pod Phenotyping Pipeline – Methodology Overview

## Overview
The pod phenotyping workflow extracts quantitative morphological traits
from RGB images using segmentation and skeleton-based analysis.

## Key Steps
1. Foreground-background separation
2. Contour detection and size filtering
3. Skeleton-based length and width estimation
4. Robust width aggregation to reduce outlier effects
5. Optional shape and texture descriptors

## Quality Control
Each pod is accompanied by a visual overlay that enables
rapid validation of measurements.
